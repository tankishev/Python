Solutions to problems from SoftUni Python Fundamentals

I've created this repository to post my solutions to the problems in the SoftUni Python Fundamentals class. All of the solutions posted provide 100/100 points in Judge. I've also atttempted to solve each of the problems using only the topics already covered in the course modules prior to the problem. For example the maze problems in Advanced Lists can be solved using recursive functions but I have solved them using lists only.

I hope these provide guidance for your solutions.
