# As a young adventurer, you travel with your group worldwide, seeking for gold and glory. 
# But you need to split the profit among your companions.
# 
# You will receive a group size. 
# After that, you receive the days of the adventure. 
# 
# Every day, you earn 50 coins, but you also spend 2 coins per companion for food. 
# Every 3rd (third) day, you organize a motivational party, spending 3 coins per companion for drinking water. 
# Every 5th (fifth) day, you slay a boss monster and gain 20 coins per companion. But if you have a motivational party the same day, you spend additional 2 coins per companion. 
# Every 10th (tenth) day at the start of the day, 2 (two) of your companions leave, but every 15th (fifteenth) day 5 (five) new companions are joined at the beginning of the day.
# You should calculate how many coins gets each companion at the end of the adventure.
# Input / Constraints
# The input will consist of exactly 2 lines:
# •	group size – integer in the range [1…100]
# •	days – integer in the range [1…100]
# Output
# Print the following message: "{companions_count} companions received {coins} coins each."
# Note: You cannot split a coin, so you should round down the coins to an integer number.
