# The Player class should receive a name (string), a hp (int), and a mp (int) upon initialization.
# The Player also has 2 instance attributes: skills (empty dictionary that will contain the skills of
# each player and its mana cost) and a guild set to "Unaffiliated" by default.
# The Player class should also have two additional methods:
# -	add_skill(skill_name, mana_cost)
# o	Adds the skill and the corresponding mana cost to the dictionary of skills.
# Returns "Skill {skill_name} added to the collection of the player {player_name}"
# o	If the skill is already in the collection, returns "Skill already added"
# -	player_info()
# o	Returns the player's information, including their skills, in this format:
# "Name: {player_name}
#  Guild: {guild_name}
#  HP: {hp}
#  MP: {mp}
#  ==={skill_name_1} - {skill_mana_cost}
#  ==={skill_name_2} - {skill_mana_cost}
#  â€¦
#  ==={skill_name_N} - {skill_mana_cost}"
